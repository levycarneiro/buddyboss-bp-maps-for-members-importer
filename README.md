This script is meant for this particular use case:

- You use the BuddyBoss theme/plugin on your site
- You have additional fields for address: City / State / Country
- You installed the BP Maps for Members plugin
- This maps plugin doesn't use the existing data from those 3 fields.
- It uses only a Location-type field, which has a geocode.
- So one needs to convert the data from the 3 fields into a geocode that the plugin can use.
